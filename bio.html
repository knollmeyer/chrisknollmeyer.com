<p>From Massachusetts, writing music since 2007. First learning the piano at 7 years old, then guitar at 11, all the while listening to hip-hop radio religiously. Playing in bands in middle school and high school, leading to recording demos at home for the bands to learn. Learning recording led to learning synthesis and sampling software, resulting in the desire to study music further in college. As a student at CalArts, continued writing music and performing in ensembles. Went on to learn sound for other media such as film and dance performance. Thesis performance was an audio/visual presentation of various 3d animations and a live soundtrack. An obsession with the equipment used to make music led to working at various instrument companies, juggled with writing and performing music. Based in New York since 2015, writing music every day.</p>
