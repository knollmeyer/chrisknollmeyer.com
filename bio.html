From Massachusetts, writing music since 2007 on piano and guitar. Playing in bands in middle school and high school lead to recording demos at home for the bands to learn, which led to synthesis, which let to a Music Tech degree from CalArts. Went on to learn sound for other media such as film and dance. Thesis performance was an audio/visual presentation of various 3d animations and a live soundtrack. Anyway, based in New York since 2015, writing music every day.
